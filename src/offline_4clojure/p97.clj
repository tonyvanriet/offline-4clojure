;; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle">Pascal's triangle</a> is a triangle of numbers computed using the following rules:<br/></br>- The first row is 1.</br>- Each successive row is computed by adding together adjacent numbers in the row above, and adding a 1 to the beginning and end of the row.<br/><br/>Write a function which returns the nth row of Pascal's Triangle.
