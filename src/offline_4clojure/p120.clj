;; Sum of square of digits - Easy
;; Write a function which takes a collection of integers as an argument.  Return the count of how many elements are smaller than the sum of their squared component digits.  For example: 10 is larger than 1 squared plus 0 squared; whereas 15 is smaller than 1 squared plus 5 squared.
